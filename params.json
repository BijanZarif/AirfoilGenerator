Simply input the 4 digits defining a NACA 4-Series airfoil and click CREATE. In the current implementation, this script only generates airfoils with a finite trailing edge.\r\n\r\n### NACA 4-Series Geometry Description\r\n* The 1st digit is the maximum camber\r\n* The 2nd digit is the maximum camber location \r\n* The 3rd and 4th digits represent the maximum thickness\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n* All digits are a percentage of the chord length\r\n* Maximum thickness occurs at 30% of the chord\r\n* Chord length fixed to a unit length\r\n* All airfoils have a flat trailing edge\r\n\r\n### Example, NACA 2412\r\n* Maximum camber is 2% of the chord\r\n* Maximum camber located at 40% of the chord\r\n* Maximum thickness is 12% of the chord (located at 30% of the chord)\r\n\r\n![NACA2412](https://raw.github.com/pointwise/AirfoilGenerator/master/NACAImage.png)\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\nScripts are freely provided.
